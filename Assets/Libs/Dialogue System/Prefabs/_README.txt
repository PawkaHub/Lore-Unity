/*
This folder contains prefabs that you can use in your projects. Prefabs inside subfolders named
"Resources" may be automatically loaded by the Dialogue System as default values if your project 
hasn't set the dialogue UI or camera angles prefab.

Chat Mapper Template/Template.cmp: A template Chat Mapper project designed for the Dialogue System.

Camera Angles: Contains a prefab with a selection of camera angles that you can reference in
your cutscene sequences.

Unity Dialogue UIs: Contains a large selection of legacy Unity GUI-based dialogue UIs that you can use
to set the Dialogue System's appearance in your project. You can delete any you don't need, but don't
delete the Default folder; this contains the default fallback UI that the Dialogue System uses if it
can't access your regular UI. Prefabs that use the new Unity UI are in Scripts/Supplemental/UI/Prefabs.
If you're using Unity 4.x, you must import Scripts/Unity UI Support first.

iOS: Contains platform-specific utility files for iOS projects.
